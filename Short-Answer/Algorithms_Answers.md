#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n) because it runs for as long as a < n, and increases by a factor of n * n.

b) This is O(n log n) because the inner loop increments at a greater rate.

c) This is O(n) because it recursively returns an amount that's roughly equal to n.

## Exercise II

if a building is n stories tall and an egg only breaks if it is thrown off of f or higher then,
as long as you are only dropping eggs at f or lower the eggs should be safe (for real what is f? 
.0001% of the first floor)
safe_eggs:
    for n in building:
        if n is less than f:
            return safe eggs
        else:
            return haha eggs go splat
