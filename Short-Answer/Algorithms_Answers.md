#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n) because it runs for as long as a < n, and increases by a factor of n * n.

b) This is O(n log n) because the inner loop increments at a greater rate.

c) This is O(n) because it recursively returns an amount that's roughly equal to n.
